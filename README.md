# CPSC 210 Project

## Game Party Finder and Tracker

A *bulleted* list:
- Members of a group have *roles* that indicate which games they play. 
  - If someone wants to play a *certain multiplayer game*, it sends a status request to the people who have roles in that game
  - This application will help users **find game parties** in a 'chat room' like environment and **track win-rates** with players
- People who have a *group of friends* that play multiplayer games will use this to conveniently find parties without having to go through extensive communication to do so
- This project is of interest to me due to my own personal experience of having very convoluted and confusing conversations of who wants to play a certain game. Even when implementing a callout system it was still hard to reach people and confirm attendance.
